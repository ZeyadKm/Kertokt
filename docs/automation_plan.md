# Automation Plan for Consumer Report Analysis

## Overview
The objective is to automatically ingest and analyze documents that detail
water quality, utility company offerings, home warranties, home insurance, and
health insurance plans. The system will summarize key findings, flag potential
issues, and recommend actions that save customers money and help them maximize
benefitsâ€”similar to how services like DoNotPay streamline consumer advocacy.

## Data Sources
- **EWG Water Quality Reports**: Continue parsing contaminants, compliance
  issues, and health benchmarks.
- **Utility Company Water Quality Reports**: Ingest municipal utility PDFs,
  HTML pages, and CSV datasets to extract contaminant levels, service updates,
  and available customer programs.
- **Utility Company Offerings**: Track rebates, conservation incentives,
  leak-detection programs, and payment assistance.
- **Home Warranty & Insurance Plans**: Parse coverage tables, exclusions,
  deductibles, and renewal deadlines.
- **Health Insurance Plans**: Identify preventive care benefits, telehealth
  options, and reimbursement opportunities connected to water quality (e.g.,
  filters prescribed for medical reasons).

## Key Components
1. **Document Ingestion**
   - Use a crawler to monitor and download new or updated reports from utility
     sites (e.g., Denver Water) and other providers.
   - Support multiple formats via specialized parsers (PDF, HTML, CSV, JSON).

2. **Information Extraction**
   - Apply OCR for scanned PDFs and leverage NLP pipelines (spaCy, transformers)
     to detect entities, contaminants, program names, deadlines, and monetary
     values.
   - Normalize data to a shared schema so results from different utilities and
     insurers are comparable.

3. **Knowledge Base & Rules Engine**
   - Store extracted facts in a structured database (e.g., PostgreSQL or
     Elasticsearch) with versioned entries.
   - Maintain rules to detect out-of-compliance metrics, underused benefits,
     or expiring offers.

4. **Action Recommendation Layer**
   - Generate personalized guidance: e.g., recommend requesting a free water
     quality test, applying for a rebate, or filing a warranty claim.
   - Provide automation hooks (email templates, pre-filled forms) to reduce the
     friction of taking action.

5. **User Experience**
   - Dashboard that highlights urgent issues, potential savings, and new
     findings.
   - Notification system (email/SMS/app) to alert customers when a new report or
     benefit becomes available.

## Next Steps
- Build proof-of-concept parsers for a small set of utility reports.
- Extend the existing EWG ingestion pipeline to the unified schema.
- Prototype the rules engine to flag high-priority recommendations.
- Conduct user testing to validate the usefulness of automated suggestions.

## Long-Term Vision
Create a comprehensive consumer advocacy assistant that continuously monitors
household-related services, ensures safety and compliance, and automates the
process of claiming the benefits that customers are entitled to.
