## Automatic Analysis of Consumer Reports

This project explores how we can help customers automatically analyze a wide
range of water-quality and household service reportsâ€”going beyond the EWG
reports to include utility company documents, insurance plans, and home
warranty offers. The goal is to surface actionable insights and recommended
next steps so that households can make the most of the services they already
pay for.

See [docs/automation_plan.md](docs/automation_plan.md) for a deeper look at the
initial product and technical approach.
